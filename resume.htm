									<h5>2012.12 - Present: Research on improvement of Automatic Test Pattern Generation algorithm</h5>
									<b>Project Description: </b>
									During the internship in School of Software in Tsinghua University, I work in the laboratory of micro-electronics and my mentor is Prof. Dong Xiang. My work focused on Atalanta, an open source ATPG tool and fault simulator for combinational circuits. We need to improve its test compression rate by furnishing it with more functionality such as influence cone analysis, selective static compression and so on.
									<br>
									<b>Responsibility: </b>
									In charge of management and improvement of the Atalanta source code, including removing the bugs in Atalanta and helping with experiments written in the Prof. Xiang��s paper.
								</li>
								<li>
									<h5>2012.11 - 2013.03: Research on experimental platform technique of virtualized network</h5>
									<b>Project Description: </b>
									The project mainly researched on the connectivity problem between virtual cloud platforms like VMware vSphere, Xen and virtual device simulation tools like GNS3, inlcuding designing the tunnel protocol and routing algorithm for data packets between virtual network and physical network. We implement a prototype system based on principles of VPN and NAT.
									<br>
									<b>Responsibility: </b>
									Focus on the design work of protocol encapsulation and routing algorithm, the rule deployment scheme of virtualized network configuration and implementaion of routing driver in Windows written by NDIS programing.
								</li>
								<li>
									<h5>2012.03 - 2013.01: Research on automatic network penetration test technique</h5>
									<b>Project Description: </b>
									The project mainly researched on the automatic generation and execution of penetration test scheme, during the scheme enforcement, vulnerability and penetration process can be combined and springboard technique is utilized for further penetration.
									<br>
									<b>Responsibility: </b>
									In charge of the development team which consists of three postgraduate members.
								</li>
								<li>
									<h5>2012.02 - 2012.07: Research on RBAC policy conflict analytic technique based on colored petri net</h5>
									<b>Project Description: </b>
									The project mainly researched on RBAC policy conflict analyzing technique in Microsoft Active Directory surroundings. We have achieved automatic extraction of users, groups, shared resources and access control lists. Conflict detection approaches respectively based on colored petri net and description logic have been proposed, detection reports can be retrieved which consist of conflict locations, types and reasons.
									<br>
									<b>Responsibility: </b>
									Responsible for the system implementation of domain information extraction and conflict detection.
								</li>
								<li>
									<h5>2011.09 - 2011.12: Development of access control policy conflict detection system of collaborated environment</h5>
									<b>Project Description: </b>
									The project mainly researched on the information security demand of China Aero-Polytechnology Establishment and designed a XACML policy conflict detection system based on multi-domain environment. Our system alerts to potential policy conflicts and help improve the security of crosss-domain operations.
									<br>
									<b>Responsibility: </b>
									Main coder in the development team, responsible for the policy integration and sub-graph matching modules.
