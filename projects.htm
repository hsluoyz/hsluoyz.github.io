							<p>
								<b>Project Description:</b>
								The project mainly researched on the connectivity problem between virtual cloud platforms like VMware vSphere, Xen and virtual device simulation tools like GNS3, inlcuding designing the tunnel protocol and routing algorithm for data packets between virtual network and physical network. We implement a prototype system based on principles of VPN and NAT.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Responsibility:</b>
								I focus on the design work of protocol encapsulation and routing algorithm, the rule deployment scheme of virtualized network configuration and implementaion of routing driver in Windows written by NDIS programing.

							<p>
								<b>Project Description:</b>
								VisualPSD aims to capture the packets received by the current machine and analyze whether there's malicious code mixed in them. The hackers usually utilize the delicately contructed packet to send to the vulnerable machines and the code the malicious packet is going to execute is called shellcode. So if we detect the shellcode contained in a packet, we are able to protect the host from the network attacks no matter whether the host is vulnerable or not.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Responsibility:</b>
								I am responsible for all the design and programming work of VisualPSD.

								<b>Project Description:</b>
								The project mainly researched on RBAC policy conflict analyzing technique in Microsoft Active Directory surroundings. We have achieved automatic extraction of users, groups, shared resources and access control lists. Conflict detection approaches respectively based on colored petri net and description logic have been proposed, detection reports can be retrieved which consist of conflict locations, types and reasons.
